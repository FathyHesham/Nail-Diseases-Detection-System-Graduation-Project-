## Overview
This project is a **Graduation Project** developed by students from **Ahram Canadian University, Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology**. The system uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **image processing** techniques to detect and classify nail diseases from images. The application is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to upload images of their nails and receive a diagnosis with high accuracy.

---

## Motivation
Nail diseases can be indicators of underlying health issues, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. However, diagnosing nail diseases can be time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge. This project aims to:
- Provide a **quick and accurate** tool for nail disease detection.
- Assist doctors in diagnosing diseases more efficiently.
- Help the general public identify potential nail diseases and seek appropriate medical attention.

---

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for uploading nail images and receiving results.
- **High Accuracy**: The model achieves an accuracy of **88.90%** using **ResNet-50** architecture.
- **Multiple Disease Detection**: The system can detect **9 different nail diseases**.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, cropping, and flipping are used to improve model performance.
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models like **VGG-16** and **ResNet-50** are used to enhance accuracy.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Web Development**: Bootstrap, Flask (for backend)
- **Data Augmentation**: Image rotation, cropping, zooming, flipping
- **Model Training**: AdamW optimizer, Dropout, Regularization, Early Stopping

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains **10 types of nail diseases** with a total of **12700 raw images**. The diseases included are:
1. **Healthy Nail**
2. **Terry's Nail**
3. **Clubbing**
4. **Acral Lentiginous Melanoma**
5. **Pitting**
6. **Blue Finger**
7. **Koilonychia**
8. **Beau's Lines**
9. **Muehrcke's Lines**

---

## How It Works
1. **Image Upload**: Users upload an image of their nail through the web interface.
2. **Preprocessing**: The image is preprocessed (blurring, shearing, equalization) to prepare it for the model.
3. **Model Prediction**: The preprocessed image is fed into the **CNN model**, which predicts the disease.
4. **Result Display**: The system displays the predicted disease along with the probability of each possible disease.
5. **Recommendation**: Users are advised on which type of doctor to consult based on the diagnosis.
